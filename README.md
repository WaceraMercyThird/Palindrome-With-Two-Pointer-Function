## Two Pointer Function And Palindrome 

Check whether characters in a string are palindrome or not using two pointer function

**A palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward as forward.**

- create a string inside a valiable
- from the left of the string or the start of the string equal to zero
- To the left equals the length of the string minus 1 which represent the last character
- Use a while loop to check if left is less than right or start is less than end, meaning start will not go above or beyond end.

After that this is what will happen:
- if the first character is not the last character return "is not palindrome" otherwise return is palindrome 
Otherwise it will print "is Palindrome" whereby the while loop condition iterate by start going forword with end going backwords
